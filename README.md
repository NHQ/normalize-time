# normalize-time
This is a normalizer for time-based stuff.  The module is a function that takes 4 arguments:
*start time
*duration
*min
*max

min and max are optional, and wil default to 0 and 1 respectively.

It returns a function that takes a single param, time
```
npm install normalize-time
```
## usage
```js
var tnorm = require('normalize-time');
var time = new Date().getTime();
var duration = 3000;

var normalize = tnorm(time, duration)

for(var t = time; t < time + duration){
	console.log(normalize(t));
	t = new Date().getTime();
}
```
What we have done here is created a function that will normalize 3 seconds of time to values between zero and one.  We could have passed min and max values to normalize between any two values.
